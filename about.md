  Hey there! My name is Alexa Jakob. I'm a sophomore at Cooper Union studying electrical engineering, and I'm interested in hardware and
  cybersecurity. I also play violin and enjoy a good game of Catan. Tardigrades are the best animals, prove me wrong:

  My theme is a Jekyll theme called Hydeout by Andrew Fong.
