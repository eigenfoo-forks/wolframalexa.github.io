  Hey there! My name is Alexa, I'm a sophomore at Cooper Union studying electrical engineering, and I'm interested in hardware and cybersecurity. I play violin and enjoy a good game of Catan. A proponent of the Oxford comma and the metric system, I speak English, French, and Spanish and hail from the faraway land of Canada. Tardigrades are the best animals, <a href="mailto:alexajakob@tutanota.com"> prove me wrong </a> (or just email me memes, that's fine too).

<p>  
  My theme is a Jekyll theme called <a href="https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout">Hydeout</a> by Andrew Fong.
