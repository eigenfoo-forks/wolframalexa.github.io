  Hey there! My name is Alexa Jakob. I'm a sophomore at Cooper Union studying electrical engineering, and I'm interested in hardware and cybersecurity. I play violin and enjoy a good game of Catan. A proponent of the Oxford comma and the metric system, I speak English, French, and Spanish and hail from the faraway land of Canada. Tardigrades are the best animals, prove me wrong: alexajakob@tutanota.com.

  My theme is a Jekyll theme called Hydeout by Andrew Fong.
