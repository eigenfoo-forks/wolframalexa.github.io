<h2>The Dinosaur Game: Digital Logic Design Final Project (May 
2019)</h2>

As part of my final project for ECE150: Digital Logic Design, my partner Hadassah Yanofsky (EE '22) and I built a version of Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game using only 40XX series CMOS chips. I was responsible for the random obstacle generation and the display. I created two pseudo random number generators using shift registers and XOR/XNOR gates, one that would allow for the generation of a random obstacle (one LED bird, one LED tree, two LED bird, two LED tree) and the other to generate these at random time intervals. Displaying the outputs on the board involved working with a sequence of shift registers to manage the progression of obstacles across the board and soldering an LED matrix. 

You can read the technical details of how we accomplished this in our documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7AopN-quus8UlS3rx4m_0wKX9mxa_iP11Y8uOVm4rU/edit?usp=sharing) (includes circuit diagrams and videos of the project in action).

Other projects for Digital Logic Design include the Traffic Light and Braille individual projects, my documentation for which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mU8ysq5N06wHEdOlbwmxjcJd6YPX3huf1eCUNwub21E/edit?usp=sharing) for Traffic Light and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4otYoUxSXOOWUxVkir43FO-LzfDG4o3zMiSYjK4KY/edit?usp=sharing) for Braille.

DLD is notoriously a difficult class at Cooper Union, but I got a lot out of it. Strangely enough, this class is the reason I became an electrical engineer: I loved the challenge of debugging and thinking of creative ways to put different components together. I am eternally grateful to the upperclass students who took a look at my circuits real quick when they had a second. My hope is that future EEs will also take advantage of this opportunity to learn, which is why I wrote a [very informal debugging guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jchooMjtJD4IQuMNcmuCUVm8EsrD7xMd4JpCYZS4_pU/edit?usp=sharing) for the class projects based on what I've learned, and I hope that it is helpful.
