<h2>The Dinosaur Game: Digital Logic Design Final Project (May 
2019)</h2>

My partner Hadassah Yanofsky (EE '22) and I built a version of Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game using only 40XX series CMOS chips. I was responsible for the random obstacle generation and the display.

You can read the technical details of how we accomplished this in our documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f7AopN-quus8UlS3rx4m_0wKX9mxa_iP11Y8uOVm4rU/edit?usp=sharing) (includes circuit diagrams and videos of the project in action).

Other projects for Digital Logic Design include the Traffic Light and Braille individual projects, my documentation for which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mU8ysq5N06wHEdOlbwmxjcJd6YPX3huf1eCUNwub21E/edit?usp=sharing) for Traffic Light and [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10a4otYoUxSXOOWUxVkir43FO-LzfDG4o3zMiSYjK4KY/edit?usp=sharing) for Braille.

DLD is notoriously a difficult class at Cooper Union, but it's the reason I became an electrical engineer: I love the challenges of debugging, adapting to setbacks, and thinking of creative ways to put different components together. I am eternally grateful to the upperclass students who took a look at my circuits real quick when they had a second. My hope is that future EEs will also take advantage of this opportunity to learn, which is why I wrote a [very informal debugging guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jchooMjtJD4IQuMNcmuCUVm8EsrD7xMd4JpCYZS4_pU/edit?usp=sharing) for the class projects based on what I've learned, and I hope that it is helpful.

<h2>Formula SAE Team (September 2018-May 2019)</h2>

[Cooper Union's FSAE team](http://fsae.cooper.edu) is a group of student motorsports enthusiasts who design, build, test, and race a Formula One-style racecar in Brooklyn, Michigan every year. The competition includes both dynamic races and static design evaluations as well as cost and business presentations in which teams must present the market-readiness of their car. In my time on the team, I was a member of the chassis system.

As a member of the aerodynamics subsystem, I laid the groundwork for future teams to implement a Drag Reduction System (documentation link to follow), projected to decrease drag by 50%, which will greatly ameliorate the team's times particularly in the acceleration and skidpad events.

My additional responsibilities included performing carbon fiber layups end-to-end, building a PVC frame for driver fitting, preparing the business presentation, and managing two sponsorship accounts worth over $2,000.
